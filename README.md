# Timer
A minimalist minute-timer with a custom seven-segment display look, available at https://aliceree.github.io/timer/.

The timer starts from a single input field: type the desired number of minutes, press `Enter`, and the screen switches to a glowing countdown made of virtual LCD segments. The interface is intentionally sparse so the segmented digits become the whole focus.

## Features
- **Instant input:** The initial screen shows an LCD-style cursor where you enter any number of minutes (decimals are rounded to seconds).  
- **Immersive display:** After pressing `Enter`, the input disappears and you get a full-screen neon countdown.  
- **Smart reset:** When the timer reaches zero, the display returns to the input mode automatically.  
- **Pause/Resume:** Press the **space bar** to freeze the digits in place and continue whenever you like.

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).  
2. Enter the number of minutes and hit `Enter`.  
3. Pause or resume using the **space bar**.
