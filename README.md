## Features
- **Instant input:** A black start screen with an LCD-style cursor. Enter any number of minutes.
- **Immersive display:** After pressing `Enter`, the input disappears and you get a countdown.
- **Fullscreen toggle:** Press `R` to expand the countdown to full screen, and press `R` again to shrink it back.
- **Pause/Resume:** Press the `space bar` to freeze the digits in place and continue whenever you like.
- **Exit to start:** Press `Esc` to end the countdown and return to the black input screen.

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).  
2. Enter the number of minutes and hit `Enter`.  
3. Use keyboard shortcuts: **Space** = pause/resume, **R** = toggle fullscreen, **Esc** = exit back to the start screen.
