# Timer
A minimalist minute-timer with a custom seven-segment display look, available at https://aliceree.github.io/timer/.

The app opens to a pitch-black screen with an LCD-style cursor. Type the number of **minutes** you want to count down and press `Enter` — the input disappears and you get a glowing countdown made of virtual segments.

It’s intentionally sparse so the digits become the whole focus.

## Features
- **Instant input:** A black start screen with an LCD-style cursor — enter any number of minutes (decimals are rounded to seconds).
- **Immersive display:** After pressing `Enter`, the input disappears and you get a neon seven-segment countdown.
- **Fullscreen toggle:** Press **R** to expand the countdown to full screen, and press **R** again to shrink it back.
- **Pause/Resume:** Press the **space bar** to freeze the digits in place and continue whenever you like.
- **Exit to start:** Press **Esc** to end the countdown and return to the black input screen.

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).  
2. Enter the number of minutes and hit `Enter`.  
3. Use keyboard shortcuts: **Space** = pause/resume, **R** = toggle fullscreen, **Esc** = exit back to the start screen.
